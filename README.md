# :diamonds: The Diamond Competition :diamonds:

## Description:
This project is based on a kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/diamonds-datamad0820) where students from the data analysis bootcamp compete to obtain the best score at trying to predict the price of a diamond base on its characteristics. This model is a supervised machine learning model where we obtain a dataset with the following features:
- id: only for test & sample submission files, id for prediction sample identification
- price: price in USD
- carat: weight of the diamond
- cut: quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
- color: diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)
- clarity: a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))
- x: length in mm
- y: width in mm
- z: depth in mm
- depth: total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)
- table: width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)

In my project, 4 different models were created in order to obtain the best possible score, which are:
- Linear Regression model
- Random Forest model 
- Ada Boost model 
- Extra Trees model 

In the file analisis.ipynb you can find the cleaning and model creation code that I developed this weekend, that goes from transforming strings to numerical data, to dropping columns and obtaining the clean dataset needed for the model training.
The best score I could obtain was a root mean squared error of 528,23.

I really enjoyed making these models and competing to see who could obtain the best, altough I would have loved to have more time in order to top myself on my hightest score.
Hope you enjoy!
